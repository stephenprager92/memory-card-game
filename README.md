## Instructions

This project is a simple browser-based card game that tests the user's ability to remember pairs of matching symbols. There are 16 cards on the board, all of which begin the game flipped face down. Click on a card to flip it over and reveal its symbol. When two *unmatched* cards are flipped, they will display briefly and then automatically return to their flipped position. When two *matching* cards are flipped, they will remain flipped for the remainder of the game. The user must focus on remembering and flipping pairs until all 16 cards have been matched. 

The game is scored in two ways:
1.  Star count, which is derived from the number of moves the user has currently taken. A three-star score is possible if the game is beaten in 15 or fewer moves, while a two-star score is possible if the game is beaten in 25 or fewer moves. 26 or more moves will result in a one-star score.
2.  Time to complete. This is measured in seconds and indicates how long the player has taken to beat the game.

In order to begin playing this game, you will need the full contents of this repository. This includes:

2.  css folder
    * app.css
    * responsive.css
